In the past I wrote some posts on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@robinbakker). But having my own website, I thought it would be better to have these posts here as well. Also, it would be easy to post new stories. Time to add a new blog section!

## Eleventy (11ty)

I already use [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) for my website. Eleventy is a static site generator, which offers a lot of flexibility and is quick and relatively easy to use.
